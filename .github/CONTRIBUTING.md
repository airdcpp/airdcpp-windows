# Posting a feature request?

Unless it's totally obvious, it's always good to explain your user case and why the requested feature is needed. Features with good reasoning are much more likely to get implemented.


# Reporting a bug?

If the issue can't be reproduced, try to describe that what happened before the crash/issue occurred.

If the issue can be reproduced, you may also want to try the [latest beta version](https://airdcpp.net/docs/installation/windows.html) to see if it has been fixed already.

### UI/API/extension related issues

Please report bugs for the web-related functionality at https://github.com/airdcpp-web/airdcpp-webclient/issues

Note that extension crashes/timeouts should first be reported on the issue tracker of the respective extension.

### Application crashes

Include all text from the generated crash log to your bug report. The log location is shown at the crash dialog.

### Application freezes/deadlocks

If the application becomes unresponsive, please see the [guide](https://github.com/airdcpp/airdcpp-windows/wiki/Client-hangs-(deadlock)) for retrieving information from a frozen client.
