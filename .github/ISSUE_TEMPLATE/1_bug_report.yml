        When AirDC++ crash it will usually create an `exceptioninfo.txt`. Open it and verify it is the correct date and time of the crash.                                                                                                                 
        If the client only becames unresponse without crashing, please see the **[instructions](https://github.com/airdcpp/airdcpp-windows/wiki/Client-hangs-(deadlock))** for getting information out of a frozen client.
